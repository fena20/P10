# Sensitivity Analysis Notes
# --------------------------
# 1. Monotonic Constraints: Model uses Tweedie objective with optional monotonic
#    constraints on HDD (positive) and TOTSQFT_EN (positive). Ablation shows
#    constraints slightly increase RMSE but improve physics plausibility.
#
# 2. COVID Controls: Model includes TELLWORK and ATHOME indicators as proxies
#    for pandemic-era occupancy. Sensitivity to COVID control mode is documented
#    but full ablation requires separate runs.
#
# 3. Technology Assignment: Using primary_only rule. Hybrid/ambiguous cases
#    are modeled separately but results should be interpreted with caution.
#
# 4. Calibration: Model applies isotonic post-calibration to reduce tail bias.
#    This improves calibration slope but does not fully eliminate underprediction
#    at high consumption levels.
#
# 5. Subgroup wR²: Low/negative wR² for electric subgroups reflects high noise
#    in RECS end-use estimates and low within-group variance. Weighted correlation
#    (r) is provided as complementary metric.
